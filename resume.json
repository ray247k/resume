        "summary": "I'm a diplomatic/motivated programmer and graduated from National Formosa University(Information Management with B.S degree).As Far as I am concerned, programing is a creation with signature and also the attitude of a programmer. What kind of code you wrote, how others will evaluate you. So I asked myself to write elegant code while considering performance and maintenance. I am passionate about the community, actively participates in relevant gatherings to absorb the experiences of others and is glad to share my stories, so I established \"Front-end study group\".I were received a lot of help on this road, so that I am also willing to lend a helping hand to become a hero of others. I believe sharing can make me be a better person.",
